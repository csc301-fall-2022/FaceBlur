# Running:
1. Ensure that your local instance of postgres is started, and that you have performed the prisma migrations
2. Run `docker-compose up --build`, which will spin up backend and frontend containers, and run both of them. **NOTE**: The DB is not containerized, it will connect your local postgres.
