## Product Details

#### Q1: What are you planning to build?

We are planning to build a web-app that enables U of T Researchers to analyze videos of children while ignoring either the background of the video, or the face of the child. This allows viewers of videos to analyze the situation in the background of the video without being affected by the child, or to analyze the emotions and reactions of the child without knowledge of the background situation. It also anonymizes children, if our users wish to publish the videos to support research. The web-app will be similar to a file library where the user can upload, store, and watch the videos from the studies with the added feature of blurring the component the user wants blurred (faces/ background).

 > Short (1 - 2 min' read)
 * Start with a single sentence, high-level description of the product.
 * Be clear - Describe the problem you are solving in simple terms.
 * Be concrete. For example:
    * What are you planning to build? Is it a website, mobile app,
   browser extension, command-line app, etc.?
    * When describing the problem/need, give concrete examples of common use cases.
    * Assume your the reader knows nothing about the problem domain and provide the necessary context.
 * Focus on *what* your product does, and avoid discussing *how* you're going to implement it.
   For example: This is not the time or the place to talk about which programming language and/or framework you are planning to use.
 * **Feel free (and very much encouraged) to include useful diagrams, mock-ups and/or links**.


#### Q2: Who are your target users?

Our target users are Researchers at the University of Toronto who are within the Toronto Early Cognition Lab, and who wish to upload and/or view recordings from earlier dates.

  > Short (1 - 2 min' read max)
 * Be specific (e.g. a 'a third-year university student studying Computer Science' and not 'a student')
 * **Feel free to use personas. You can create your personas as part of this Markdown file, or add a link to an external site (for example, [Xtensio](https://xtensio.com/user-persona/)).**

#### Q3: Why would your users choose your product? What are they using today to solve their problem/need?

By using our product the researchers at the University of Toronto Early Cognition Lab would be able to save time as they would be able to quickly upload a video and could choose to automatically blur either the background or the face of the people in the videos. They would be able to save the results into a database on the same web application where they can quickly find any previously uploaded and processed videos that they may want to use. Currently as the researchers arenâ€™t using anything to solve their current problem, they would have to manually blur the faces or backgrounds of their videos using third party applications and then download and reupload the video file to a separate database which is a process that our product streamlines and condenses into one web application.

> Short (1 - 2 min' read max)
 * We want you to "connect the dots" for us - Why does your product (as described in your answer to Q1) fits the needs of your users (as described in your answer to Q2)?
 * Explain the benefits of your product explicitly & clearly. For example:
    * Save users time (how much?)
    * Allow users to discover new information (which information? And, why couldn't they discover it before?)
    * Provide users with more accurate and/or informative data (what kind of data? Why is it useful to them?)
    * Does this application exist in another form? If so, how does your differ and provide value to the users?
    * How does this align with your partner's organization's values/mission/mandate?

#### Q4: How will you build it?

> Short (1-2 min' read max)
 * What is the technology stack? Specify any and all languages, frameworks, libraries, PaaS products or tools.
 * How will you deploy the application?
 * Describe the architecture - what are the high level components or patterns you will use? Diagrams are useful here.
 * Will you be using third party applications or APIs? If so, what are they?
 * What is your testing strategy?

#### Q5: What are the user stories that make up the MVP?

1. As a researcher at the Toronto Early Cognition Lab, I want to be able to save the videos that have been blurred in order to rewatch them at a later date.

Given the user has logged in, has uploaded a video file, and possibly selected to blur it, when the user selects to save the video, then the user is redirected back to the homepage, the video is saved to the database, and is displayed in the list of saved videos in the homepage.


2. As a researcher at the Toronto Early Cognition Lab, I want to be able to upload videos in order to automatically blur out faces or backgrounds.

Given the user has logged in and has a properly formatted video file (ex. JPEG), when the user chooses that file and selects to upload it on the webapp, then the video is displayed to the user on the web-app and the user is presented with the option of saving or blurring the file.


3. As a researcher at the Toronto Early Cognition Lab, I want to be able to select whether to blur the faces of children or the backgroud in order to control the variables in the study and focus on certain variables, for instance, facial expressions.

Given the user has logged in and has uploaded a video file, when the user asks to blur the faces of the children in the video, then the blurring process takes place, the page is refreshed, the video with the faces blurred is displayed and the user is presented with the option to save the new video in place of the original video.

Given the user has logged in and has uploaded a video file, when the user asks to blur the background in the video, then the blurring process takes place, the page is refreshed, the video with the background blurred is displayed and the user is presented with the option to save the new video in place of the original video.


4. As a researcher at the Toronto Early Cognition Lab, I want to be able to search through the saved videos in order to easily find a specific video I want to watch.

Given the webapp contains video files and the user has logged in, when the user searches the title of a video in the search bar, then ensure all videos whose title contains the searched words are found and those videos are displayed to the user.

5. As a researcher at the Toronto Early Cognition Lab, I want to have a login/authentication process in order to only allow other researchers at the Toronto Early Cognition Lab and I to have access to these videos so that the children's privacy stays protected.

Given that the user is a memeber of the Toronto Early Cognition Lab, when the user tries to log in, then ensure their login credentials are in the stored login data and redirect the user to the homepage of the webapp.

 * At least 5 user stories concerning the main features of the application - note that this can broken down further
 * You must follow proper user story format (as taught in lecture) ```As a <user of the app>, I want to <do something in the app> in order to <accomplish some goal>```
 * User stories must contain acceptance criteria. Examples of user stories with different formats can be found here: https://www.justinmind.com/blog/user-story-examples/. **It is important that you provide a link to an artifact containing your user stories**.
 * If you have a partner, these must be reviewed and accepted by them. You need to include the evidence of partner approval (e.g., screenshot from email) or at least communication to the partner (e.g., email you sent)

#### Q7: What operational events will you have as a team?
We plan on having short meetings twice a week online to update each other on which tasks we have completed and also to assign tasks.

In our meeting with our partner, we discussed an overview of the entire project. This included what was required and our reach goals. In addition to this, we also recieved guidance on what tech stack we should use. We will continue to have meetings with our partner weekly on Mondays.

Describe meetings (and other events) you are planning to have.
 * When and where? Recurring or ad hoc? In-person or online?
 * What's the purpose of each meeting?
 * Other events could be coding sessions, code reviews, quick weekly sync meeting online, etc.

## Highlights
- decisions:
   - Flow for uploading
   - ORM vs direct to database?
   - Deployment using Docker vs not?
   -
*

1. We made key decisions regarding the user flow for processing & uploading blurred videos. We considered the following:
   - any uploaded video be automatically processed such that we created & saved 3 videos, one with faces blurred, one with backgrounds blurred, and one unblurred. This meant the least user involvement, and was made under the assumption that researchers would want all 3 videos all the time.
   - The upload dialogue allows users to choose to blur face or background, and then preview the result. This meant users could check the results before uploading.
   Finally, we decided on a flow where an upload dialogue is opened, users can choose which blurs to apply, and then upload.
2. We chose between an ORM and directly interfacing with our database. The positives of directly interfacing with our database are performance and control. However, we decided on using an ORM because our application does not need to be that performant. Also, the major bottleneck for runtime is going to be processing the video, so performance of our database is not that important. We also are slated to have ~11 users, so our scale is low, further lessening the importance of performance. Control is not relevant for similar reasons, so we chose the more developer friendly option of an ORM.
3. We also decided between SQL and NoSQL. When considering the choice of a NoSQL DB, we considered the primary benefits, namely flexible schema and scalability. However, for our usecase, these are both not particularly relevant. Our schema is well-defined and unlikely to change, and also quite simple. Scalability is not important because our planned userbase is 11 users. Therefore, we chose to use SQL, because of it's stability & concrete schema, meaning our future development work will be simpler.
