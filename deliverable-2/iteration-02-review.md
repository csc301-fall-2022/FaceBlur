## Iteration 02 - Review & Retrospect

 * When: November 4th, 2022
 * Where: Online via Discord Call

## Process - Reflection


#### Q1. Decisions that turned out well

List **process-related** (i.e. team organization and how you work) decisions that, in retrospect, turned out to be successful.

**1. Weekly stand-up meetings:**
* The decision to have weekly standups was successful because it allowed everyone on the team to get context on what was being worked on, and provided an oppourtunity for us to identify any blockers
* It was a time for us to discuss the state of the current work and talk about future tasks 

**2. Discord github workflow integration**
* This provides real time notifications of new commits and PRs, and it is in the same place where we do all of our team communication
* This makes it easy for us to view active branches and PR status, and makes our workflow faster 

#### Q2. Decisions that did not turn out as well as we hoped

List **process-related** (i.e. team organization and how you work) decisions that, in retrospect, were not as successful as you thought they would be.

 * 2 - 4 decisions.
 * Ordered from most to least important.
 * Explain why (i.e. give a supporting argument) you consider a decision to be unsuccessful
 * Feel free to refer/link to process artifact(s).


#### Q3. Planned changes

1. We are planning to formalize having the weekly tutorial section also serve as a standup, in addition to our current weekly standup every Monday morning. We are making this change because we have had issues where people working on tickets that are dependent on each other are not aware of the status of each other's tickets, complicating development and ultimately slowing down progress. Currently we often have an informal standup during tutorial, but we plan to make it formal to ensure it happens each time.
2. We currently use a discord bot that messages the server every time anyone commits. This isn't super useful because there is an overload of information. Ideally, it would just notify someone if they were requested for a PR review. We want to either configure the bot to do that, or simply make a policy of always DMing teammates whenever you want them to review your PR. This will tighten the review & resolve cycle
3. We are going to do a better job of reaching out when someone has been on the same issue for a long time. This will just ensure no one gets stuck on a ticket.


## Product - Review

#### Q4. How was your product demo?
 * How did you prepare your demo?
 * What did you manage to demo to your partner?
 * Did your partner accept the features?
 * Were there change requests?
 * What did you learn from the demo from either a process or product perspective?
 * *This section will be marked very leniently so keep it brief and just make sure the points are addressed*
