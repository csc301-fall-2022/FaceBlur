## Iteration 02 - Review & Retrospect

 * When: November 4th, 2022
 * Where: Online via Discord Call

## Process - Reflection


#### Q1. Decisions that turned out well

**1. Weekly stand-up meetings:**
* The decision to have weekly standups was successful because it allowed everyone on the team to get context on what was being worked on, and provided an oppourtunity for us to identify any blockers
* It was a time for us to discuss the state of the current work and talk about future tasks 

**2. GitHub projects board**
* This allowed us to successfully track the progress of current tasks and see which tasks need to be worked on in the future
* Tasks can be assigned to members and PRs can be linked to them

#### Q2. Decisions that did not turn out as well as we hoped

**1. Discord github workflow integration**
* The notifications tend to have too much information which isn't very useful to our workflow

**2. Tracking meeting minutes**
 * This decision was unsuccessful because we weren't able to commit to documenting the meetings in our meeting-minutes folder, so we have no documentation of things that were discussed 

#### Q3. Planned changes

1. We are planning to formalize having the weekly tutorial section also serve as a standup, in addition to our current weekly standup every Monday morning. We are making this change because we have had issues where people working on tickets that are dependent on each other are not aware of the status of each other's tickets, complicating development and ultimately slowing down progress. Currently we often have an informal standup during tutorial, but we plan to make it formal to ensure it happens each time.
2. We currently use a discord bot that messages the server every time anyone commits. This isn't super useful because there is an overload of information. Ideally, it would just notify someone if they were requested for a PR review. We want to either configure the bot to do that, or simply make a policy of always DMing teammates whenever you want them to review your PR. This will tighten the review & resolve cycle
3. We are going to do a better job of reaching out when someone has been on the same issue for a long time. This will just ensure no one gets stuck on a ticket.


## Product - Review

#### Q4. How was your product demo?
 * How did you prepare your demo?
 * What did you manage to demo to your partner?
 * Did your partner accept the features?
 * Were there change requests?
 * What did you learn from the demo from either a process or product perspective?
 * *This section will be marked very leniently so keep it brief and just make sure the points are addressed*
